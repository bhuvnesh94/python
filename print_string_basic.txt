* Next up, strings, what are they? Strings are just "strings" of text, hence the name. Strings are a type of data. Another type of data is integers.
* While we're talking about strings and the print function, it would be useful to discuss concatenation. Concatenation just means the combination of things. You can use the "+" or the "," to join strings together. If you use a ",", then you will have a space in between the strings you joined. If you use a "+", then the strings will be strung together with no space. You will need to add one if you wanted.
* If you use the "+" to join integers and floats together, then you will perform an arithmetic operation. If you use the ",", then it will print them out separately, with a space.
* You cannot use the "+" to join strings with ints or floats, you must use the ",".
* It is also important to bring up how to put quotes within strings. You can either put double quotes inside single quotes, singles inside doubles, or use the "\" backslash. The \ character is known as an escape character, and it will "escape" the characteristic of the following character and just take on the 'visual' aspect of it.
* The purpose of the "escape character" is to escape various characteristics for characters. For example, a quotation, ", in a string might wreak havoc. Take for example: x = "He said, "Hello there!" "
* Yeah, that's going to be a problem. There are obviously many options to avoid this specific problem, but one of them would be to use an escape character:

x = "He said, \"Hello there!\" "

If you do a print(x), you will not see the escape characters, and you will see the quotes. Sometimes you want to show the escape character as well:

x = "An escape character is a \"
